## Features

- **Cute and Customizable UI**: A kawaii-themed interface that lets you create and manipulate objects with ease.
- **Physics Integration**: Powered by Box2D for realistic movement, collisions, and gravity.
- **Scene Management**: Easily manage multiple scenes within a project.
- **Object Creation & Manipulation**: Add, move, resize, and delete objects directly in the engine.
- **Color Picker**: Customize object colors through a built-in RGB slider.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Nya-Engine.git
   ```
2. **Install L√ñVE2D**:
   - Download [L√ñVE2D](https://love2d.org/) (version 11.3 or newer).
   - Follow the instructions on the L√ñVE2D website for installation.

3. **Run the Engine**:
   ```bash
   love Nya-Engine
   ```

## Usage

### 1. Launching Nya Engine

Open the Nya Engine project using L√ñVE2D:
```bash
love .
```

### 2. Adding Objects

Use the UI buttons to add, select, delete, or modify objects within the scene. Each object is represented visually in the editor and can be customized.

## Creating Your First Object

1. Launch Nya Engine and load the default scene.
2. Use the **"Add Object"** button to create a new game object.
3. Modify its properties:
   - **Position**: Drag and drop it on the screen.
   - **Color**: Use the color picker to adjust the object's color.
   - **Physics**: The object will fall and interact with other physics-enabled objects.

## UI Features

The Nya Engine UI is designed with a kawaii aesthetic and includes:

- **Add/Delete Buttons**: Quickly add or remove objects from the scene.
- **Color Picker**: Adjust RGB values to customize object colors.
- **Physics Control**: Easily switch between static, dynamic, and kinematic physics types.

## Physics Integration

Nya Engine utilizes L√ñVE2D's built-in Box2D engine for physics, which provides:

- **Gravity**: Objects will fall according to the set gravity.
- **Collision Detection**: Objects will collide naturally with others in the scene.
- **Body Types**: Supports `dynamic`, `static`, and `kinematic` body types for diverse object behaviors.

### Example Physics Object

```lua
local PhysicsObject = require("physics_object")
local box = PhysicsObject:new(NyaEngine.physicsWorld, 400, 100, 50, 50, "dynamic")
NyaEngine.activeScene:addObject(box)
```
